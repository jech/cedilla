                          Installing cedilla


Cedilla relies on the CLISP implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language.  For more information about CLISP, please see

  http://www.cons.org

1. Edit the file ‘cedilla-config’ to point it at the CLISP binary
   installed on your system..

2. Type ‘./compile-cedilla’.  This step will create a bunch of ‘*.fas’
   files as well as the files ‘cedilla’ and ‘install-cedilla’.

3. Type ‘su -c "sh ./install-cedilla"’.  This step will copy ‘cedilla’,
   the ‘*.fas’ files as well as ‘cedilla-config.lisp’ to random
   locations in your filesystem.

4. Edit the file ‘/etc/cedilla-config.lisp’ to point at available font
   metric files and font files.

If you're using the darcs tree rather than a distribution tarball, you
will need to run the ‘predist’ script before compiling cedilla.
